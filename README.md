# Team Project: Printf - Custom Formatting Function

## Introduction

Welcome to our team project, **Printf**, where we will be creating a custom formatting function for producing output according to a specified format. This project aims to simulate the behavior of the standard C library's `printf` function while also handling some custom conversion specifiers. We are dedicated to delivering a reliable and efficient solution for printing formatted output in C.

## Motto

"I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life." - Team Printf

## Conversion Specifiers

Our custom `printf` function will be able to handle the following conversion specifiers:

- **%d**: Print signed decimal integer
- **%i**: Print signed decimal integer
- **%u**: Print unsigned decimal integer
- **%o**: Print unsigned octal (base 8) number
- **%x**: Print unsigned hexadecimal (base 16) number (lowercase)
- **%X**: Print unsigned hexadecimal (base 16) number (uppercase)
- **%p**: Print pointer address

## Custom Conversion Specifiers

In addition to the standard conversion specifiers, our custom `printf` function will also handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

- **%r**: Print a string in reverse
- **%R**: Print the Rot13 encoding of a string
- **%w**: Print the string with alternating uppercase and lowercase characters
- **%s**: Print the string, replacing spaces with underscores
- **%S**: Print the string, replacing spaces with asterisks

## Local Buffer Optimization

To minimize the number of calls to the system's `write` function, we will utilize a local buffer of 1024 characters in our implementation.

## Additional Features

Our custom `printf` function will support the following features:

- Field Width: Allowing the user to specify the minimum width for the output.
- Precision: Providing the ability to set the precision for floating-point numbers.
- Flag Characters: Handling flag characters like `0` and `-` for alignment purposes.

## Collaboration

We believe that education and experience go hand in hand. As a team, we are committed to working together, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other to create a powerful and efficient custom `printf` function.

## Let's Print!

With the combined effort of our team, we are confident that our custom `printf` function will be a success and serve as a valuable tool for handling formatted output in C. Let's embark on this journey together and make printing in C a smoother and more enjoyable experience.
